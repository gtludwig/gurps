## We are converting to a new build process and the use of Typescript.   The 'main' branch may become unusable in the near future.  Once we complete the conversion, we will provide details on how you can use the new build.

### Until then, we will continue to develop 0.8.XX builds on the 'pre-release' and 'release' branches.
